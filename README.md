# About our MOOPS!
The platform starts with a sign-in process, after which
users can view their profile. From there, they can book tickets and hotel rooms
through dedicated pages for tours and travel bookings. The geographical
indication feature is accessible via the search button at the top center of the
homepage, and notifications appear at set intervals. The MoogAI (voice bot), a
key feature, can be accessed by clicking the cow icon on the top left. The Know-
from-the-People feature allows users to share feedback on their visits and
dining experiences, offering cuisine recommendations and alerts about less-
visited places. Users earn Mooney reward points for this feedback, which can be
used for ticket and hotel discounts. The Itinerary page provides tailored travel
itineraries based on the user's stay duration, along with packing tips. We have
also tried to incorporate all the booster point features.
